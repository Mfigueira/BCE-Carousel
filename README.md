# Slider IO

## What is this?

Slider IO is a versatil Items Slider Component.

## What items are supported?

An 'item' can be anything as long as the component keeps the basic HTML structure provided in order to work.

Personal style (css) can be added after the base css is included into the site.

## Can I see a working example?

Yes! In [this](https://mfigueira.github.io/slider-io/) link you can find examples with different amounts of items into the slider container, to show the flexible behavior.
